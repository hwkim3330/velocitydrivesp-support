= What is this

VelocityDRIVE-SP is a SW platform capable of providing full firmware images for
various Ethernet Switches. VelocityDRIVE-SP based firmware offers CoAP/CORECONF
management server.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a set of scripts making it
possible to interact with the CoAP/CORECONF management interface offered by
VelocityDRIVE-SP.

Beside from offering "vanilla" CoAP as defined by RFC7252, the firmware also
offers a UART based protocol called MUP1 (Microchip Uart Protocol 1). MUP1 is a
point-2-point protocol, which can among other things carry CoAP frames. This
makes it possible to do CORECONF requests over IPv4 (as normal) or over MUP1.
The advantage of MUP1 is that it can also be used when no IP address is
configured, or no Ethernet connection is possible/desired.

= Audience

This repository is intended for SW Developers or HW designers working with
VelocityDRIVE-SP. SW Developers may be creating alternative client SW,
evaluating features, or working with CORECONF/RFC7951/RFC9254/RFC9595 and wants
to leverage the conversion functions. HW designers may need to tailor a binary
to a board.

IMPORTANT: This is not the only client SW, for UI based and more end-user
oriented client tool ask your Microchip support team about access to
VelocityDRIVE-CT.

= Usage of YAML/JSON/RFC7951 along with CORECONF

Most of the tools in this repository uses the JSON/YAML encoding of YANG data as
defined in RFC7951 as input/output format, and then converts this to CBOR when
communicating with a CORECONF server.

This format has been chosen for the following reasons:
- The CBOR format used by CORECONF is binary, and even if converted to the
  CBOR-Diag format, it is still using SID (numbers) instead of strings making it
  hard to read/write.
- It is an established standard used in RESTCONF which is also a YANG based
  management interface.

A "yang" catalog containing all relevant YANG models (including deviations) and
SID files is required to perform such conversion. If using a tool which connects
to a device, then the tool will start by reading out the SHA of the YANG catalog
and the download it form [1]. If used in "offline" mode, then the yang-catalog
must be provided manually.

= What can I do with this

The `support/scripts/` include a bunch of scripts making it easier to work with
VelocityDRIVE-SP based firmware. Following is a brief walk through of some of
the provided scripts:

- `bc2cbor`: Convert YAML based board configuration files into CBOR. This is
  used to tailor a binary to a given board.
- `dbgreg`: Debug tool for accessing registers.
- `mup1cc`: MUP1-Coreconf-Client. This tool can connect to a switch running
  VelocityDRIVE-SP and perform iPatch/Fetch requests (and more) against the
  running config datastore. All input/output are done in RFC7951 formant, and
  on-the-fly converted to CBOR.
- `mup1ct`: MUP1-Client-Tool. This tool can a switch running VelocityDRIVE-SP
  and perform CoAP requests over MUP1. This tool will not do any conversion of
  the payload which is useful to do firmware updates. It can also be used to
  transfer CBOR data directly and thereby do CORECONF requests, this is
  how-ever not recommended in most cases.
- `pyang`: This is a small wrapper to make it easier to call `pyang` with the
  SID plugin enabled.
- `yang-enc`: This tool can do various encoding/decoding of YANG data - most
  important it can convert between RFC7951 and RFC9254 formats.


= How to use it

The easiest way to use the scripts provided in this repo is to use the provided
Docker container and the `dr` script.

The `dr` script is from: https://github.com/microchip-ung/docker-run which also
offer a general introduction.

To use it in this repository, copy the `dr` script into `/usr/local/bin` if you
do not have it already:

    $ sudo cp dr /usr/local/bin

Then try use the `dr` script to run a script:

    $ dr mup1cc --help

If docker is working on your machine, and if you are a member of the docker
group, then this should automatic pull the docker image configured in the
`.docker.env` file and run the `./support/scripts/mup1cc --help` command.

Next time the `dr` command is used, the docker image will be cached and it
should be fast to do.

== Access to UART in Docker

The `.docker.env` will map uart devices if it can detect them, but it will run
the command as a non-privileged user. It can therefore be necessary to change
the permissions of the uart device:

    $ chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

= Examples

    # Get and show running configuration:
    $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -q c=c -m get

    # Get and status
    $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m get

    # Create a L3/VLAN interface and assign an IP address
    # Ignore the schema errors printed by the mup1cc command - these are known
    # errors in the schema, the command will work anyway.
    cat <<-EOF > ipatch-req-set-ip.yaml
    - ? "/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='L3V1']"
      : name: "L3V1"
        ietf-ip:ipv4:
          address:
          - ip: "10.0.0.1"
            prefix-length: 24
    EOF
    $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m ipatch -i ipatch-req-set-ip.yaml

    # Change the security-mode of the IP/CoAP server to no-sec (disable DTLS).
    # (Not recommended in production - but useful doing development)
    $ cat <<-EOF > ipatch-req-no-sec.yaml
    - "/mchp-velocitysp-system:coap-server/config/security-mode": "no-sec"
    EOF
    $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m ipatch -i ipatch-req-no-sec.yaml


    # Get interface config and status for port 1 and 2:
    $ cat <<-EOF > fetch-req-port-get.yaml
    - "/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='1']"
    - "/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='2']"
    EOF
    dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m fetch -i fetch-req-port-get.yaml

    # Save running config:
    $ cat <<-EOF > rpc-req-save-running.yaml
    - "/mchp-velocitysp-system:save-config":
    EOF
    dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m post -i rpc-req-save-running.yaml

= Just for publishing

This repository is currently only being used to publish selected scripts from a
non-public upstream repository. This means that pull-requests are not accepted,
and the git-log is not really use full as it is mostly just "import-commits"
where the support-folder is copied from the upstream repo to this.
